    "description": "We recently took a little vacation with my parents, and started playing the old board game password, while we were on the trip. Since we're old, we sometimes had trouble reading the password cards, and I decided to create a digital version. There's a simple and a managed version. The simple version just gives you some words that you can walk through and basic scoring. The managed version has the ability to sync data on the back end and a shared score between players on different teams.",

To better understand how much experience we have as guides we are required to keep logbooks of the time we spend instructing, off-roading, training etc. Also, if we want to get paid, we are required to fill out a time sheet and submit an invoice. These 3 tasks had been completely separate from one another. This litte app combines those three tasks, so as long as you fill out your logbook your invoice and timesheet are generated for you. It is intended as a mobile first experience, so that guides can quickly (30 seconds) log their work for the day when they get back to basecamp from their phones. I wrote this before I had taken any formal web dev courses, so it's an interesting mixture of things.",

Then there was a few months working in the basement pouring a layer of epoxy, then waiting 24 hours for it to dry. Finally finishing took probably at least a few weeks starting with 40 grit sandpaper and working all the way up to 2000 grit.",
